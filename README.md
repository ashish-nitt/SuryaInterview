Goal
====

The purpose of this problem is for the interviewer to get a quick sense of how you write code. This problem should not take you more than a couple of hours to solve.

Although this is a toy problem, please make sure your solution is of production quality. You should be comfortable checking your solution into your code base. Use proper names, check for errors, etc. The whole point of this exercise is for it to be representative of how you code on the job :).


Constraints
===========

- Your solution must be written in either Python or Java.
- You may use any libraries and tools of your choice.
- You must provide a solution that can be run on a unix system (preferably OS X 10.9.5, but any unix system will do).
- You must provide instructions on how to build and run your code.


Submission
==========

The best way to submit a solution is to put it up on a public Github or Bitbucket repository and send me a link to it. If that's not an option (please explain why), a zip file should be sent.


Problem
=======

A JSON over HTTP API is deployed at `http://surya-interview.appspot.com`. The goal is to performance test it. This involves making two requests.

The first request is an HTTP `GET` request to `http://surya-interview.appspot.com/message` that contains a header titled `X-Surya-Email-Id`. This must contain your email address. The response will be a HTTP 200 (unless there's an error - if it's a 400 class error, you did something wrong; if it's a 500 class error, please let me know via email) and contain a JSON body which has the email id you sent as a header, as well as a uuid. Example:

```
200 OK
{
  "emailId": "gps@surya-soft.com",
  "uuid": "fa674442-c513-4b1f-8dce-47f70307143c"
}
```

The second request is an HTTP `POST` request to `http://surya-interview.appspot.com/message`. The post body must be JSON and must two field: `emailId` (exactly the same value as you sent before), and `uuid` (the value that was returned in the previous response). Example:

```
{
  "emailId": "gps@surya-soft.com",
  "uuid": "fa674442-c513-4b1f-8dce-47f70307143c"
}
```

The response if successful will be a HTTP 200, with a body that reads `Success`. If you get a 400 class error you did something wrong. If you get a 500 class error, please let me know via email.

You are expected to make each of these requests 100 times and provide the following statistics for the response time of each API:

- 10th percentile
- 50th percentile
- 90th percentile
- 95th percentile
- 99th percentile
- Mean
- Standard Deviation

Please note that your solution *must be* concurrent. That is, you cannot make 200 requests in sequence. You should be making at least 10 requests at a time. Obviously, since one of the requests requires data from the previous response, you will have to do those in sequence.
